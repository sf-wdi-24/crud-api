## ESLint for Linting and Auto-fix

This project uses [eslint](http://eslint.org/)! The base configuration is [standard JS](https://standardjs.com/), with additional rules as defined in [.eslintrc.json](.eslintrc.json).  

To run the linter on this project without changing files, use the following command line command:

```
./node_modules/eslint/bin/eslint.js ./
```

If you would like ESLint and standard to automatically fix linting issues, use the `--fix` option:


```
./node_modules/eslint/bin/eslint.js ./ --fix
```

Especially when using the --fix option, prefer to lint one file or directory at a time by specifying a path within the project:

```
./node_modules/eslint/bin/eslint.js ./controllers/index.js ./controllers/utils.js
```

As a shorthand to run the linter on the entire project directory, you can use `npm run lint`.

Ingored directories and files are listed in  [.eslintignore](.eslintignore).


## Automated Tests with Mocha, Chai, supertest

The command `npm test` runs all test code.
